# MakeupApp
I developed this app as a capstone project for the launchcode program. This app is used to keep track of makeup inventory. Currently, a user can enter a category,
within that category a user can enter a product. The product is listed with a name, brand, color, cost, amount purchased, quantity, and rating. The categories also
have pages that list all items within that category. I have included a shopping list. I am in the process of developing a scanner to allow a user to scan the 
barcode to add the data into the app.
